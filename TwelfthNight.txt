Twelfth Night
CLOWN: Apt in good faith very apt Well go thy way if Sir Toby would leave drinking thou wert as witty a piece of Eves flesh as any in Illyria
MARIA: Peace you rogue no more o that Here comes my lady make your excuse wisely you were best
CLOWN: Wit andt be thy will put me into good fooling Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man For what says Quinapalus Better a witty fool than a foolish wit God bless thee lady
